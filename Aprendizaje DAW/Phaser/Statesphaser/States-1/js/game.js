// The first two integers are the dimensions of the game screen as x
// and y values. We are setting it to 640 pixels across, and 480 pixels
// down. Note also that the 'gameDiv' parameter matches the div element
// defined in our index.html file
var game = new Phaser.game(640, 480, Phaser.AUTO, 'gameDiv');

// Here we add each state. We give it a casual name that we use when
// calling it (i.e 'boot'), and an official name that we use when
// defining it (i.e. bootState), as you'll see in the boot.js file
game.state.add('boot', bootState);
game.state.add('load', loadState);
game.state.add('menu', menuState);
game.state.add('play', playState);
game.state.add('win', winState);

// After all of the states are added, we start the game by calling the
// boot state
game.state.start('boot');
